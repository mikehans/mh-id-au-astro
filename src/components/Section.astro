        Styles have been moved to global owing to how Astro handles the CSS modules.
        For elements that are part of the component, they gain a class specific to the component.
        CSS is applied with a :where(.astro-ASSDDF) selector.
        This selector is only applied to elements that are part of the component, not to elements 
            brought in through the <slot />.
