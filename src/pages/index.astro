  <Section sectionHeading="Hi I'm Mike">
    <p>I'm a software developer, woodworker, gardener and beer enthusiast.</p>
    <p>
      I maintain a tech blog here where I write about web development topics and
      also show the tech projects I have underway or have completed. If they are
      in a running state, you'll be able to check it out. They come and go - I
      don't have production constraints.
