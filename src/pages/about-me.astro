    <p>
      I'm a software developer with extensive experience in web development,
      Microsoft Office and other unmentionables that I'd like to forget.
    </p>

    <p>
      I blog about different aspects of web development such as React, C#,
      NodeJS and databases, though I touch on other topics of interest as well.

      I live in Melbourne, Australia with family. I'm something of a beer
      enthusiast, gardener and woodworker. I try to grow vegetables and
      periodically wonder what to do with a glut in some vegetable or another or
      to bemoan the failure of some other crop. This year, the tomatoes have
      been really poor.

      This site is definitely a work in progress too. The process of owning and
      building a site is one that I generally wouldn't experience while working
      for others and it exposes me to new elements such as owning a domain,
      managing hosting and configuring TLS.
